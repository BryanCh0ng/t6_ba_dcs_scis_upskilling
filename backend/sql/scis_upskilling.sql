They are absolutely right, as this course is extremely intense and you have no one but yourself to rely on. Although this is not necessarily a bad thing, this is one of the course that I might not retain much memory of once I've finished it. I want to believe that the school expects this outcome, as students are learning new heavy topics each week. While the professor explained it by saying this is to \"prepare us for the project\", cramping new topics every week is very questionable to me, ESPECIALLY since some topics are algorithm-related topics which are extremely heavy and hard to digest. Additionally, topics such as \"counting\" is really testing my mathematics skills, and no matter how hard I try to understand it, I am unable to visualize how to solve such problems when the difficulty increases. It makes me question the practicality of this topic in computational thinking. Last but not least, with regards to difficulty, I am not sure if the school heard about it, but the midterms for this year, was a far cry from the tutorial and sample midterm questions provided to us. It is insulting and demoralizing to think that after practicing the sample paper and tutorials, I am still seemingly performing badly for the test. This happened to my peers as well. I would like to bring this to attention as the difficulty spike is really insulting, and I believe many students share similar thoughts. Regardless, I am still glad to have taken it as learning about algorithm does improve my coding ability, allowing me to understand and write cleaner codes as an SMU IS student.
